**You must have latest version of Chrome Driver for your operating System [download](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads)**

**Go to the `conf.py` file and set the value of  `CHROME_DRIVER_PATH`  to the path of installation of Chrome Driver in your system**

See other Requirements in `requirements.txt`

# **Using This API you can achieve many things in less than 5 lines of code**

## **Sending a formatted message with emojis **

```python
from whatsapp import WhatsApp
msg = """	*laughing*  :-) 
	neutral_face :-| _stuck_out_tongue_  :-p
	~heart~  <3  simple_smile :-) 
	*worried* :-( (n) 
	thumbsup: (y) wink: ; - ) """
wapp = WhatsApp(100)
wapp.send_message('Name', msg)

```
**Result** 

![Image of Result](ScreenShots/emojiDemo.png)


## **Sending Customized Messages in Bulk ie Dynamic Batch Messaging **

### Suppose you have a csv file like this
**The csv file must have a header , see below example (line 1 is header)
The csv file must have a NAME coloumn**
(the name which is saved in your phone)

![csv file image](ScreenShots/csvfile.png)

### And you also have a template string (prefix variables with dollar sign)
```python
from whatsapp import WhatsApp
wapp = WhatsApp(100)
temp = """
Hi ! *$NAME* , you haved scored *$marks* in Exam

Your Detailed Report :
	_RANK_ : *$rank*
	_PERCENTILE_ : *$perc*
	_GRADE_ : *$grade*

:-) Keep Studying (y)
"""  # prefix the variables with a dollar sign
wapp.send_messages_in_batch('students.csv', temp)
# the function send_messages_in_batch takes two arguments csv file path and template
```
**Result**

## Running from an existing session
It it very difficult for us to scan the QR code for logging in everytime if the session is not saved, you can avoid it by adding the session parameter like this,
```python
# SWAMI KARUPPASWAMI THUNNAI

import os
from whatsapp import WhatsApp

whatsapp = WhatsApp(100, session="mysession")
whatsapp.send_document("Thamarai", os.path.join(os.getcwd(), "message.txt"))
```

Your data will be saved into `mysession` folder from the above example. Make sure you protect your session folder.

## Getting the status message of a person

```python
from whatsapp import WhatsApp
whatsapp = WhatsApp(10)
print(whatsapp.get_status("Name"))
```

## Getting last seen of a person

```python
from whatsapp import WhatsApp
whatsapp = WhatsApp(10)
print(whatsapp.get_last_seen("Name"))
```

## Getting the no of participants in the group

```python
from whatsapp import WhatsApp
whatsapp = WhatsApp(10)
result = app.participants_count_for_group("The Night Ghost Company")
```

## creating a new group and getting invite link

```python
# SWAMI KARUPPASWAMI THUNNAI
from whatsapp import WhatsApp
import time
app = WhatsApp(100)
parameter1: group name, parameter 2: group members
app.create_group("group", ["Thamarai", "Jeeva"])
time.sleep(10)
print(app.get_invite_link_for_group("group"))
```

**Join the group using invite link**
```python
# SWAMI KARUPPASWAMI THUNNAI
from whatsapp import WhatsApp
app = WhatsApp(10)
app.override_timeout(30)
app.join_group("https://chat.whatsapp.com/4AIA2B3GuLp4RJOKF0M8zY")
app.send_blind_message("I am in :)")
```


## Exiting the group
```python
# SWAMI KARUPPASWAMI THUNNAI
from whatsapp import WhatsApp
app = WhatsApp(100)
app.exit_group("X-Test")

```

## Sending Anonymous messages [WHATSAPP WILL BAN YOUR PHONE NUMBER IF YOU SEND MANY ANONYMOUS MESSAGES] </br>
*Note: The phone number should not contain spaces and special characters(+, -) but shall contain country code. Example: +91-861 123 4567 should be formatted to 918611234567*
```python
# SWAMI KARUPPASWAMI THUNNAI
from whatsapp import WhatsApp
app = WhatsApp(10)
app.send_anon_message("91XXXXXXXXXX", "I am sorry for what is happening sir! But I have no other choice.")
```

## Sending Messages to multiple participants </br>
Sometimes we need to send messages to multiple persons who may or may not be in our contact list. So we need to a combination of both *send_message* and *send_anon_message*. Here is an example where we get the contact numbers from a group and sending messages to individual persons in that group.

```python
# SWAMI KARUPPASWAMI THUNNAI
from whatsapp import WhatsApp
import time

app = WhatsApp(100)
app.override_timeout(30)
participants = app.get_group_participants("GDG")
print(participants)

for participant in participants:
    print("Sending: ", participant)
    time.sleep(1)
    try:
        app.send_message(participant.strip(), "Hello, I'm a bot. And this is a research. Please ignore me and dont ping back")
    except Exception as e:
        print(e)
        participant = participant.replace("+", "")
        participant = participant.replace(" ", "")
        app.send_anon_message(participant.strip(), "Hello, I'm a bot. And this is a research. Please ignore me and dont ping back")
    app.goto_main()

```

## Sending pictures to a person

```python
# Note of Thanks: This part of code have been taken from WhatsApp Assistant bot by Jean-Claude Tissier(@jctissier).
# Github repo-link: https://github.com/jctissier/whatsapp-assistant-bot
# License: MIT
app.send_picture("Vignesh", os.getcwd()+"/pic.jpg")
```

## Sending documents to a person

```python
# SWAMI KARUPPASWAMI THUNNAI
import os
from whatsapp import WhatsApp

whatsapp = WhatsApp(100)
whatsapp.send_document("Thamarai", os.path.join(os.getcwd(), "message.txt"))
```

## Clearing the chat

```python
# SWAMI KARUPPASWAMI THUNNAI

from whatsapp import WhatsApp

whatsapp = WhatsApp(100)
whatsapp.clear_chat("Test")
```

## Getting usernames with unread messages
Will return the list of usernames for which we have yet to reply that person. Increase the count of scrolls according to your needs.

```python
# SWAMI KARUPPASWAMI THUNNAI

from whatsapp import WhatsApp

whatsapp = WhatsApp(100, session="mysession")
print(whatsapp.unread_usernames(scrolls=1000))
```

and we will receive an output as a Python list. Something like this,

```
['Ziv Freelance Employer', 'Vignesh', 'InstagramTest', '+91 9xx36 8xxx2', 'Sundar Sir', '+91 xxx47 8xxx9']
```

## Getting the last sent messages for a username

```python
# SWAMI KARUPPASWAMI THUNNAI

from whatsapp import WhatsApp

whatsapp = WhatsApp(100, session="mysession")
messages = whatsapp.get_last_message_for("Thamarai")
print(messages)
```

*Note:* I am still working on it and it might break.

## Interesting use cases

**Replying to all stale messages:**

```python
# SWAMI KARUPPASWAMI THUNNAI

from whatsapp import WhatsApp

whatsapp = WhatsApp(100, session="mysession")
usernames = whatsapp.unread_usernames(scrolls=1000)
for username in usernames:
    try:
        whatsapp.send_message(username, "Hello I am a bot, apologies that my creator hasn't replied to you yet. please ping again. ")
        whatsapp.send_blind_message("Know more about me: https://github.com/VISWESWARAN1998/Simple-Yet-Hackable-WhatsApp-api")
    except:
        print("You don't have permission to send message to this group/person")
```
